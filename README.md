# DM Notes 🗒️

A simple yet structured WPF application for creating and managing notes. Follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, ensuring separation of concerns, testability, and scalability.

---

## Features
- Create, edit, delete notes
- Persist notes to local storage (JSON-based)
- MVVM architecture using ICommand and INotifyPropertyChanged
- Modular service abstraction with `INoteService`
- Simple UI with custom controls (e.g., SliderButton)
- Unit tests for ViewModel logic

dotnet test DM_Notes.Tests
```

---

## Build & Run

## Architecture Overview
- **MVVM Pattern:** Decouples UI from business logic.
- **RelayCommand:** Generic command binding with `ICommand`.
- **NoteServiceAdapter:** Intermediary between UI and persistence layer.
- **ErrorLogger:** Basic logging of exceptions.

---

## Requirements
- .NET Framework or .NET SDK (6.0+)
- Visual Studio or Rider (optional)

---

## Future Improvements
- Dependency Injection for Services
- SQLite integration instead of JSON
- Dark mode toggle
- Cloud synchronization (e.g., Google Drive API)
- More comprehensive test coverage
